    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My main goal in life is to just to be successful in all my career endeavors and to be generally
happy. I would like to pursue a career in networking and be financially comfortable to
provide for my family. Most of all, I want to be someone who people will know that, no
matter what the outcome was, I always gave it everything I had. I don’t want to be rich or
famous, just comfortable with the people I love. </p>

This Affinity board describes an idea for an app that can help with the overcongestion of traffic in Columbia, SC.
The ideas are a little clustered but columned in ideas that i believe are most closely related.
